# Predicting turnout in the 2022 general governor election in Texas by county
This is mainly a data exploration/learning pandas project that I took on!! I tried multiple regression methods, experimented with including/removing demographic factors, and defining "turnout" through percentage of voters rather than raw number of voters.

Mainly used Pandas, Scikit-Learn. Data is from the American Community Surveys.
